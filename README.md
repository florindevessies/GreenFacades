# Green facades for cooling urban hot spots - the data

This page functions as an online appendix to the master thesis 'Green facades for cooling urban hotspots: The cooling effectivity of green facades on spaces adjacent to and inside dwellings in Amsterdam', written by Florinde Vessies (2020). In order to maximize the reproducibility of this research, all modeling data, both input and output, are available here.

The input map contains the vector map used in Monde (.monde) and the grid-based maps of Spaces (.INX). Also the added materials (such as building materials) are included in the sys.userdata folder. The weather data of the Veenkampen weather station for the whole of 2018 so they can be read in ENVI-met are also part of this folder (.fox). Finally, all simulation files are included for all orientations with and without green facade (.simx).

The output folder contains all outputs of the eight different simulations performed. Four orientations are simulated both with and without green facade. In all folders there is also a summary folder where the results of the studied cells are available.
